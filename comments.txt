Code does not compile due to include_directories(include) and in catkin_package (see my changes)
nusim and nuturtle_control do not introduce any new include files, so they should not have an include directory.
likely you have an empty include/ direactory for these packages on your computer. 

roslaunch file spews a bunch of warnings that you have output as debugging information these messages should be removed or set to the debug level.
